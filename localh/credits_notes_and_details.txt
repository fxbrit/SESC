This section was developed by editing and adapting some parts of:
 https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-dendrogram by Mike Bostock
 https://observablehq.com/@d3/circle-packing by Mike Bostock
 https://observablehq.com/@d3/indented-tree?collection=@d3/d3-hierarchy
 A big thank you to him of course. Have a look at his great work if you liked what you saw here.

What I changed:
index.html  --> changed css reference, added a style class
index.js    --> changed path to the dendrogram/circle packing/tree
modified_dendrogram_192.css --> changed paths, texts, some parameters of the dendrogram, colours of the circles, visibility of tree elements
inspector.css   --> hid some of the outputs in order to avoid changes in runtime.js

What I did not change:
runtime.js
